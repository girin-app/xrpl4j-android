# xrpl4j-android

This library is an Android client version of xrpl4j-client.

The original xrpl4j-client does not support the Feign library on Android API levels 30 and below, so this Android-specific client was developed to provide compatibility while maintaining similar functionality.

The methods in this library follow the same specifications as the existing xrpl4j-client to ensure a consistent experience.

This project was created by GirinWallet.
